        <p>​The purpose of the LATINTATIAN website is to make available for 
          scholars and students of the European Middle Ages a convenient and 
          accurate text of Tatian's Gospel Harmony (Diatesseron) in medieval 
          Latin with an English translation.</p>

          <head>Tatian and his Writings</head>
          <p>Tatian was a Christian intellectual of Assyrian origin who lived in the second century CE.  
            The son of pagan parents, he converted to Christianity in Rome, allegedly through the influence of Justin Martyr.  
            Some years later (in 172 CE, according to Eusebius), Tatian fell out of favor with the Christian community at Rome 
            and returned to Mesopotamia, where he set himself up as a teacher of Christian doctrine.  
            Later traditions (recounted by Eusebius and Jerome) remembered him as the founder of the ascetic Christian 
            group know as the Encratites, who abstained from marriage and meat.  In the fourth century the Encratites 
            were conflated with the Manichaeans and condemned as heretics by imperial edict.</p>
          <p>Tatian was the author of several texts.  His <hi rend="italic">Oration to the Greeks</hi> was a popular work of early Christian apology 
            written in Greek and aimed at pagan readers.  It argued that Christian scriptures offered a philosophy that was 
            superior to Greek and Roman intellectual traditions.  Tatian also wrote two other treatises -- <hi rend="italic">On Animals </hi>and <hi rend="italic">On Perfection According to the Savior</hi> -- 
            both of which are now lost.  By far his most enduring composition, however, was a harmony of the four canonical Gospels with some excerpts from 
            the Acts of the Apostles known as the <hi rend="italic">Diatesseron</hi> (from the Greek, meaning "out of four").  The purpose of this work was to present the life of 
            Christ as a single, coherent story, while reconciling some of the troubling contradictions between the Gospel narratives 
            (for example, the conflicting genealogical tables in Luke and Matthew).  Scholars believe that Tatian composed the <hi rend="italic">Diatesseron</hi> either 
            in Syriac or in Greek.  The text was popular in the eastern Christian church until the fifth century, when it was actively suppressed 
            due to the growing association of Tatian with the Encratite heresy.</p>
          <p>Tatian's <hi rend="italic">Diatesseron</hi> survives in full only in Latin and Arabic translations.  It circulated in Latin as early as the second century, 
            representing one of the earliest traditions of the translation of the Gospels into Latin (the so-called vetus Latina) and predating 
            Jerome's Vulgate translation by more than two centuries.  But the widespread adoption of Jerome's translation in the early Middle Ages 
            compelled scribes to correct manuscripts of the Latin Diatesseron to conform to the conventions of the Vulgate.  As a result, almost all 
            traces of the vetus Latina version of the <hi rend="italic">Diatesseron</hi> are lost.  Even so, Tatian's work was an important and widely read text in the Latin 
            Middle Ages, surviving in dozens of manuscripts, sometimes alongside texts of the New Testament.  It was also an important tool for 
            missionary activity, providing the source for the earliest Gospel harmonies composed in northern European vernacular languages, like 
            the Old Saxon Heliand, from the ninth century.</p>

          <head>Codex Sangallensis 56</head>
          <p>Despite its importance to medieval Christians, the Latin tradition of the Diatesseron has received very little attention from scholars and 
            is virtually unknown among general readers.  LATINTATIAN attempts to remedy this by providing a single-text edition and English translation of 
            one of the earliest copies of the Diatesseron in Latin: an early ninth-century manuscript written at Fulda and now housed at the abbey of St. Gall 
            (MS St. Gallen, Stiftsbibliothek, Codex Sangallensis 56  <ptr target="http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0056"/>).  This manuscript presents Tatian's Diatesseron in Latin and Old High German side-by-side 
            in parallel columns.  While the Old High German text is important to linguists because it represents one of the earliest and longest texts to survive 
            in a German vernacular, our edition will comprise only the Latin portion of the manuscript.  Such an edition is long overdue.  The earliest publication 
            of the Latin Diatesseron based on Codex Sangallensis 56 by Eduard Sievers (1892) is well over a century old and rife with errors.  The more recent 
            publication of the same text by Achim Masser (1994) was prohibitively expensive when it was in print and is now out of print and not useful for teaching 
            purposes.  Moreover, the only complete translation of Tatian's Gospel harmony into English appeared more than a century ago in the Ante-Nicene Fathers 
            series (vol. 9, published in 1885).  Thus, LATINTATIAN provides for the first time a convenient Latin text of the Diatesseron based on an early manuscript 
            witness alongside an accurate translation into modern English.</p>
