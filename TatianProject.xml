        <p>​The purpose of the LATINTATIAN website is to make available for scholars and students of
          the European Middle Ages a convenient and accurate text of Tatian's Gospel Harmony
          (Diatesseron) in medieval Latin with an English translation.</p>

          <head>Tatian and his Writings</head>
          <p>Tatian was a Christian intellectual of Assyrian origin who lived in the second century
            CE. The son of pagan parents, he converted to Christianity in Rome, allegedly through
            the influence of Justin Martyr. Some years later (in 172 CE, according to Eusebius),
            Tatian fell out of favor with the Christian community at Rome and returned to
            Mesopotamia, where he set himself up as a teacher of Christian doctrine. Later
            traditions (recounted by Eusebius and Jerome) remembered him as the founder of the
            ascetic Christian group know as the Encratites, who abstained from marriage and meat. In
            the fourth century the Encratites were conflated with the Manichaeans and condemned as
            heretics by imperial edict.</p>
          <p>Tatian was the author of several texts. His <hi rend="italic">Oration to the
              Greeks</hi> was a popular work of early Christian apology written in Greek and aimed
            at pagan readers. It argued that Christian scriptures offered a philosophy that was
            superior to Greek and Roman intellectual traditions. Tatian also wrote two other
            treatises -- <hi rend="italic">On Animals </hi>and <hi rend="italic">On Perfection
              According to the Savior</hi> -- both of which are now lost. By far his most enduring
            composition, however, was a harmony of the four canonical Gospels with some excerpts
            from the Acts of the Apostles known as the <hi rend="italic">Diatesseron</hi> (from the
            Greek, meaning "out of four"). The purpose of this work was to present the life of
            Christ as a single, coherent story, while reconciling some of the troubling
            contradictions between the Gospel narratives (for example, the conflicting genealogical
            tables in Luke and Matthew). Scholars believe that Tatian composed the <hi rend="italic"
              >Diatesseron</hi> either in Syriac or in Greek. The text was popular in the eastern
            Christian church until the fifth century, when it was actively suppressed due to the
            growing association of Tatian with the Encratite heresy.</p>
          <p>Tatian's <hi rend="italic">Diatesseron</hi> survives in full only in Latin and Arabic
            translations. It circulated in Latin as early as the second century, representing one of
            the earliest traditions of the translation of the Gospels into Latin (the so-called
            vetus Latina) and predating Jerome's Vulgate translation by more than two centuries. But
            the widespread adoption of Jerome's translation in the early Middle Ages compelled
            scribes to correct manuscripts of the Latin Diatesseron to conform to the conventions of
            the Vulgate. As a result, almost all traces of the vetus Latina version of the <hi
              rend="italic">Diatesseron</hi> are lost. Even so, Tatian's work was an important and
            widely read text in the Latin Middle Ages, surviving in dozens of manuscripts, sometimes
            alongside texts of the New Testament. It was also an important tool for missionary
            activity, providing the source for the earliest Gospel harmonies composed in northern
            European vernacular languages, like the Old Saxon Heliand, from the ninth century.</p>

          <head>Codex Sangallensis 56</head>
          <p>Despite its importance to medieval Christians, the Latin tradition of the Diatesseron
            has received very little attention from scholars and is virtually unknown among general
            readers. LATINTATIAN attempts to remedy this by providing a single-text edition and
            English translation of one of the earliest copies of the Diatesseron in Latin: an early
            ninth-century manuscript written at Fulda and now housed at the abbey of St. Gall (MS
            St. Gallen, Stiftsbibliothek, Codex Sangallensis 56 <ptr
              target="http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0056"/>). This manuscript presents
            Tatian's Diatesseron in Latin and Old High German side-by-side in parallel columns.
            While the Old High German text is important to linguists because it represents one of
            the earliest and longest texts to survive in a German vernacular, our edition will
            comprise only the Latin portion of the manuscript. Such an edition is long overdue. The
            earliest publication of the Latin Diatesseron based on Codex Sangallensis 56 by Eduard
            Sievers (1892) is well over a century old and rife with errors. The more recent
            publication of the same text by Achim Masser (1994) was prohibitively expensive when it
            was in print and is now out of print and not useful for teaching purposes. Moreover, the
            only complete translation of Tatian's Gospel harmony into English appeared more than a
            century ago in the Ante-Nicene Fathers series (vol. 9, published in 1885). Thus,
            LATINTATIAN provides for the first time a convenient Latin text of the Diatesseron based
            on an early manuscript witness alongside an accurate translation into modern
            English.</p>

            been fulfilled among us, just as those who had seen it from the start and were ministers

          <p>In beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and God was the Word. This was in
            the beginning with God,through whom all deeds are done, and without whom there is
            nothing done which is done. In him there was life, and the life was the light of men,

          <p>There was, in the days of Herod, king of Judea, a certain priest by the name of
            Zacharias from the village of Abijah <pb/>
            <!--Page 26, chapter 3 continued - English--> and his wife was from the daughters of
            Aaron and her name was Elisabeth. Both of them, however, were just before God, walking
            in all of the commandments and formalities of the Lord without argument. And they did
            not have a son, because Elisabeth was barren and both were advanced in their days. It
            came to pass, however, that when he was serving the priesthood in the order of his turn
            before God, according to the custom of the priesthood, it fell to him by lot to offer
            incense. After he had entered into the temple of the Lord and the whole multitude of the
            people was praying outside at the hour of incense, an angel of the Lord appeared to him,
            standing to the right of the altar of incense. And seeing this, Zacharias was disturbed
            and fear rushed over him. But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zacharias,
            because your prayer has been heard and your wife, Elizabeth, will bear a son for you and
            you will name him John and you will have happiness and joy and many will rejoice at his
            birth. For he will be great before the Lord and he will drink neither wine nor strong
            drink and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even 
            <pb/> <!--Page 27, chapter 3 continued - English--> 
            from his mother's womb and he will convert
            many of the sons of Israel to the lord, their God, and he will go forth before him in
            the spirit and power of Elijah, in order to turn the hearts of their fathers toward
            their sons and the unbelieving to the wisdom of the just to prepare the perfect people
            for the Lord." And Zacharias said to the angel, "How will I know this? For I am an old
            man, and my wife is getting on in her days." (Luke 1.5-18) </p>

            these things happen because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in
            their time." And the people were waiting for Zacharias and they marveled because he was
            tarrying in the temple. And when he came out, he was unable to speak to them and they
            knew that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he nodded to them and he remained
            mute. And it happened that when the days of his duty were fulfilled, he went to his
            house. And after these days his wife Elizabeth conceived and hid herself for five
            months, saying, Because the Lord made it thus on the days when he looked upon me 
            <pb/><!--Page 27, chapter 5 continued - English-->  to

          <p>And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by the Lord to a city in Galilee
            called Nazareth, to a young woman betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph from the
            house of David and the name of the young woman was Mary. And having entered, the angel
            said to her, "Hail, full of grace! The Lord be with you! Blessed are you among women!"
            When she saw him, she was disturbed by his words and pondered the meaning of this
            greeting. And the angel said to her, "Do not fear, Mary, for you have found favor with
            God. Behold, you will conceive in your womb and you will bear a son and you will call
            his name Jesus. He will be great and he will be called the son of the most high and the
            Lord will give to him the seat of his father David and he will reign in the house of
            Jacob forever and his kingdom will have no end." And Mary said to the angel, "How can
            this be, when I have not known a man?" And responding, the angel said to her, "The Holy
            Spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you. And
            therefore the holy one who will be born will be called the son of God. And behold,
            Elizabeth, your relative, has herself conceived a son in her old age
            <!--NOTE - English--><pb/> and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren
            because no word will be impossible with God. And Mary said, "Behold! The handmaid of the
            Lord! Let it be to me according your word." And the angel departed from her. And rising
            up, Mary went to the hill country with haste in those days to the city of Judah and
            entered into the house of Zachariah [and greeted Elizabeth]. And it happened that when
            Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the child in her womb rejoiced and Elizabeth was filled
            with the Holy Spirit and she exclaimed with a loud voice, and said, "Blessed are you
            among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And how did this happen to me that
            the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold that when the sound of your greeting
            came to my ears, the child in my womb leapt with joy. And blessed is she who believed
            that those things which were said to you by the Lord would be fulfilled." And Mary said,
            "My soul glorifies the Lord and my spirit has exulted in God my salvation, for he has
            seen the humility of his handmaiden. For behold, because of this all generations will
            call me blessed, because he who is powerful did great things for me <!--NOTE - English-->
            <pb/> and his name is holy and his mercy is there from generation to generation for
            those who fear him. He showed strength in his arm. He diminished the proud in the
            disposition of their hearts. He cast down the powerful from their thrones and lifted up
            the humble. He filled the hungry with good things sent the rich away empty. He received
            Israel as his son to be mindful of his mercy, just as he said to our fathers, Abraham
            and his descendants, long ago." And Mary remained with her for about three months and
            then returned to her home. (Luke 1:26-56)</p>

          <p>And the time came for Elisabeth to deliver and she gave birth to her son. And the
            neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord made great his mercy with her and they
            congratulated her. And it happened on the eighth day, they came to circumcise the boy
            and they called him by his father's name, Zachariah. And responding, his mother said,
            "Not so, for he will be called John." And they said to her, "There is no one in your
            family who is called that." And they gave a sign to his father asking what he wanted the
            boy to be called and asking for a writign table he wrote, saying, "His name is John."
            And they all marveled. And immediately his mouth and his tongue were opened <pb/>​and he
            was speaking, blessing God. And there was fear among all of his neighbors and throughout
            the entire hill country of Judea al of these words were spread and and who had heard
            them placed him in their heard, saying "What do you think this boy will be?" For the
            hand of the Lord is with him. And his father Zachariah was filled with the Holy Spirit
            and he prophesied, saying, "Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, for he has visited and
            redeemed his people and he has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of
            David, his son, just as he said through the mouth of his holy prophets, who lived long
            ago, in order to grant us salvation from our enemies and from the power of all those who
            hate us, and grant mercy with our fathers and to be mindful of his holy covenant, the
            oath that he swore to our father Abraham, that he will grant to us so that we may serve
            him without fear freed from the power of our enemies in holiness and justice before him
            for all our days. And you, child, will be called the prophet of the most high. For you
            will go before the presence of the Lord to prepare his way in order to bestow knowledge
            of the salvation of his people for the remission of their sins
            <!--NOTE - English--><pb/> ​through the substance of the mercy of our God in which he
            visited us rising on high to illuminate those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of
            death in order to direct our steps toward the way of peace.” And the boy grew and was
            comforted by the spirit and was in the desert until the day when he was revealed to
            Israel. (Luke 1:57-80)</p>
