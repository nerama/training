        <p>â€‹The purpose of the LATINTATIAN website is to make available for 
          scholars and students of the European Middle Ages a convenient and 
          accurate text of Tatian's Gospel Harmony (Diatesseron) in medieval 
          Latin with an English translation.</p>
        <div type="section" xml:id="prefacesub1">
        <head>Tatian and his Writings</head>
        <p>Tatian was a Christian intellectual of Assyrian origin who lived in the second century CE.  
          The son of pagan parents, he converted to Christianity in Rome, allegedly through the influence of Justin Martyr.  
          Some years later (in 172 CE, according to Eusebius), Tatian fell out of favor with the Christian community at Rome 
          and returned to Mesopotamia, where he set himself up as a teacher of Christian doctrine.  
          Later traditions (recounted by Eusebius and Jerome) remembered him as the founder of the ascetic Christian 
          group know as the Encratites, who abstained from marriage and meat.  In the fourth century the Encratites 
          were conflated with the Manichaeans and condemned as heretics by imperial edict.</p>
        <p>Tatian was the author of several texts.  His Oration to the Greeks was a popular work of early Christian apology 
          written in Greek and aimed at pagan readers.  It argued that Christian scriptures offered a philosophy that was 
          superior to Greek and Roman intellectual traditions.  Tatian also wrote two other treatises -- <hi rend="italic">On Animals </hi>and <hi rend="italic">On Perfection According to the Savior</hi> -- 
          both of which are now lost.  By far his most enduring composition, however, was a harmony of the four canonical Gospels with some excerpts from 
          the Acts of the Apostles known as the Diatesseron (from the Greek, meaning "out of four").  The purpose of this work was to present the life of 
          Christ as a single, coherent story, while reconciling some of the troubling contradictions between the Gospel narratives 
          (for example, the conflicting genealogical tables in Luke and Matthew).  Scholars believe that Tatian composed the Diatesseron either 
          in Syriac or in Greek.  The text was popular in the eastern Christian church until the fifth century, when it was actively suppressed 
          due to the growing association of Tatian with the Encratite heresy.</p>
